The Port for Kafka Ports:
Think of 9092 as the front desk at an office — where clients walk in, ask questions, and drop off data.
Think of 9093 as the server room at the back — where internal staff coordinate schedules, update records, and make sure everything is running.

Currently:
1. Manually run kafka server
2. Create Topics
3. Fetch data from GTFS TTC API
4. Collect data from alerts and send to the consumer
5. Sent to MONGODB
6. Automatic new alerts every 10 seconds to see for new updates, deletes any old entires older than 10 seconds
7. Use Twillio to send SMS Notifcaiton
8. ngrok for backend to send message when "alert" is texted
9. Use Docker to containerize 

TO DO:
AWS for backend server
Kubernete
Terraform on Everyting
