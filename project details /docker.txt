Docker packages your code so it can run on any machine 

Images:
- Tech needed 
- Runtimes
- Tools and instructions to run the code

Containers:
- Things to ship out to the consumer, all the images is packaged into a container 

docker-compose.yml:
- A configuration file that lets you define and run mutiple Docker containers within this file
- It is similar to project manager for Docker

What you need to create to use Docker

| main.py        | ETL pipeline that reads GTFS alerts → Kafka → Mongo | Docker service                             |
| MongoDB        | NoSQL database storing alerts                       | Docker container (`mongo`)                 |
| Kafka          | Real-time event broker                              | Docker container (`bitnami/kafka`)         |
| Zookeeper      | Kafka needs this for coordination                   | Docker container (`bitnami/zookeeper`)     |
| GTFS API       | External API (real-time TTC alerts)                 | External dependency (no container)         |
| Docker Network | Automatically created by Docker Compose             | Lets all services communicate via hostname |

TO RUN DOCKER: docker compose up --build

What this does:
--build: builds the Docker image from your Dockerfile
up: starts all containers (main, sms_server, mongo, kafka, zookeeper)
You’ll see logs for every container right in your terminal

BONUS COMMANDS:

| Command                           | Description                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `docker ps`                       | Show running containers        |
| `docker compose logs`             | Show logs from all services    |
| `docker compose logs sms_server`  | Logs just from Flask app       |
| `docker exec -it sms_server bash` | Open terminal inside container |
| `docker images`                   | List built images              |
| `docker compose restart`          | Restart all containers         |

STOP DOCKER: docker compose down

REBUILD IMAGE: docker compose build main

CLEAN IMAGE: docker compose down -v

COPY AND PASTE TO RUN EVERYTHING:

docker compose down
docker compose build main
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
